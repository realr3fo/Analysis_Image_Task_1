# Introducction
The first project of this course is about object detection on a certain topic of interest from images. It is possible to do so without machine learning methods and the purpose of this project is to answer the question of “Can we apply the existing image analytics methods to provide an estimation of the number of people that are present in a certain image?”. This project could be useful for lifeguards as they might need a tool to gather information on the occupancy of beaches automatically. This report will serve as a documentation of this project which consists of introduction, data description and analytics, implementation, results and accuracy, and conclusion.
